// What I learned:
// 1. Working with pointers in C takes a lot of care. I had to move them forward without breaking the links, otherwise I lose track of the list.
// 2. Using interative rather than recursive is better for memory. 
// 3. Edge cases like empty lists arenâ€™t a big deal here, since the while loop condition already takes care of them.

// I didn't compare my code to others.
